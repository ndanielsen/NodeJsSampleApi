# Questions

- How do I visit the end points? Is the url localhost:3000?
- How do I hit one of the urls? for `\user`, how do I get a response? can you provide an example in the readme?
- What is the difference between `var`, `const`, `let`? Can you update the code accordingly to use the proper es6 conventions?
(Hint : https://medium.com/javascript-scene/javascript-es6-var-let-or-const-ba58b8dcde75)
- What version of the node.js are you using? Can you add an engine to the package.json?
(hint : https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#engines )


# Next Steps with Twitter

- To access twitter, use this node package: https://www.npmjs.com/package/twitter, can you implement this?
- For the twitter secrets keys, can you figure out how to use a `process.env.SECRET` to store these without committing them into code?
(hint: https://codeburst.io/process-env-what-it-is-and-why-when-how-to-use-it-effectively-505d0b2831e7)
- Can the `/twitter` endpoint return an array of all the users follows with their friends count?
- To make it easy, can you use GET params for the username for the above request?
